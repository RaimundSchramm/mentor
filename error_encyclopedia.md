###### 1. Rails-App not reachable

Use Case:
- I want to set up my Rails-App on Ubuntu inside Virtual Box inside Windows 7 host.
- I want to reach my app from my Windows 7 host.
- I want to reach my app form inside my LAN.
- I want to reach my app from outside my router.

Problem:
- App is not reachable when set up to run on binding interface 127.0.0.1.

Solution
- Assuming VirtualBox, LAN and Router are configured correctly.
- There was an update in Rails to this setting.
- It has to be 0.0.0.0 to work.
- Starting the Rails-App for example `rails server --binding 0.0.0.0` solves the problem.

###### 2. RVM Path Error

Use Case
- open Terminal
- cd to app (rvm is set up, so loading correct ruby and gemset off .ruby-versin and .ruby-gemset)
- everything works
- open another Terminal tab
- RVM-Path issue is still to fix, so cd .

Problem

- starting app for example results in error certain gem is missing (which it isn't)

Solution
- currently assuming gemset is not loaded this way, so explicitly loading it rvm gemset use name_of_gemset seems to work
- afaik it is works as intended because opening the dir in new tab just loads the default gemset while entering somehow loads from .ruby-gemset

HINTS:

recent rvm message , maybe related

Warning! PATH is not properly set up, '/home/mund/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.5/bin' is not at first place,
         usually this is caused by shell initialization files - check them for 'PATH=...' entries,
         it might also help to re-add RVM to your dotfiles: 'rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles',
         to fix temporarily in this shell session run: 'rvm use ruby-2.1.5'.

This above is something different. Make sure rvm is always the first entry in PATH variable. I accidentally had exercism in front of it.

##### 3. Firefox-Error while running tests

error was something like this: gnome.display --- Firefox-Profile not accessible or missing

seems to be associated with call of save_and_open_page inside feature spec

##### 4. WAI-error Rails has_secure_password

...works as intended...
Rails [has_secure_password](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods/has_secure_password) provides you with validation on password on creation of the including model.

I encountered a confusing behaviour when after I added validations on password, for example for length, and suddenly my User was not valid anymore.

Rails has_secure_password validation together with additional validations on password triggers on update. So for me the solution is to switch off the validation on update for every update which is not a necessary update_users-action.

```ruby
def logout!
  self.logged_in = false
  save! validate: false
end
```

##### quick, dirty and maybe works-as-intended

I thought `assert_routing` did always work for me. Having resource-routes and additional named route for users#new-resource gives me the following error in Routing Test.

```ruby
  resources :users
  get '/signup'  => 'users#new', as: :signup
```

The generated path </users/new> did not match </signup>.
  Expected: "/signup"
    Actual: "/users/new"

The same behaviour results from using `assert_generates`.

Only assert_recognizes works correctly.

Hm, I think this rights-issue is because of copying it (backup) from other user (different OS, different user).
So setting rights with `chmod` for example [as explained here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23297832/weird-rails-error-permission-denied-bin-rails-for-old-rails-apps).

##### Error installing gems for ruby 2.2.2

Usecase:
- trying to bundle new gemset
- after rvm-update to version 1.27.0 (don't know if that's related)
- for ruby-version 2.2.2

Problem:
- some gems won't install (json 1.8.3, debug_inspector 0.0.2, byebug 8.2.1 ,sqlite3 3.1.11)
- sample console-output for json 1.8.3

```
gem install json -v '1.8.3'
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing json:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

Solution:
- don't understood but works for json [as recommended here](https://github.com/flori/json/issues/259)

##### If you don't behave railsy

1)
If you implement a REST-resource for whatever reason Rails-scaffold-style and testdriven but don't respect the 'order' you could encounter path-errors because of not yet implemented routes.

For example I just wanted to testdrive the edit-action before having the show-action. Because I am not always aware of all the framework-magic I forgot that the edit-form uses a route to the show-action which gave me the error

```ruby
ActionView::Template::Error: ActionView::Template::Error: undefined method `your_resource_path' for <<Class...>
Did you mean?  trips_path
```

So either know every detail or follow a chronological order :D . First approach preferred ;) .

2)
Same as above, if you use respond_to do |format| in controller every response should go into format.xy {} notation or else you get an unknown format error which may irritate you.
